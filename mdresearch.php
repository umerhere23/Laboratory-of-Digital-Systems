			My research interests are focused on embedded systems and hardware and software co synthesis.
			During the previous years, I had been involved in implementing multimedia algorithms in embedded systems,
			targeting low power consumption while retaining a high performance. Towards this goal, I have  researched methodologies to design 
			custom   memory   hierarchies,   exploiting   them   using   high   level   algorithmic transformations.
			Also, I have investigated the implementation of IP cores at the circuit level, based on the non-conventional residue number system (RNS).
			Currently, I am working on (a)  implementing high level multimedia algorithms in VHDL (IP Cores) and 
			interfacing them with popular soft-cores (like microblaze or picoblaze), and (b) on evaluating the Data Reuse methodology
			of motion estimation algorithms, that I have been working on during the previous years, on multicore machines.
