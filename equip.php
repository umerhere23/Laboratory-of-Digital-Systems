            <h1>The Laboratory Equipment</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="equipment-section">
            <p>The laboratory consists of 10 workstations with Intel i5/2GB Ram, 3 arduino inventors kits and various sensors/peripherals, 9 reconfigurable FPGA Xilinx Spartan 3A boards, 2 devkit8000 developers kits with TI OMAP3530 (600Mhz Arm Cortex-A8) featuring a 4'' touch screen, 2 beagle boards with ARM Cortex CPU, arduino micro-controller boards and peripherals, 4 android mobiles and 2 lego mindstorm sets. Additionally, a number of servers is under the administration of the laboratory: a Nvidia Tesla Server, a 2 cluster PC with 4 powerful GPU Nvidia Geforce 9800GTX, one supercomputer with 16 cores of E5520@2.27Ghz and 76GB Ram, 4 servers with dual core processors Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.40GHz/ 8GB RAM. The operating systems of the servers and workstations are FreeBSD 9.0, Ubuntu 12 LTS and Microsoft Windows 7.</p>
            <p>Thanks to a program by the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF), the laboratory was additionally equipped with a cluster consisting of four rack mounted servers FUJITSU Server PRIMERGY RX200 S7 R2, interconnected by a gigabit Ethernet. Every server has 2 sockets of Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 clocked at 2.90GHz, each one having 6 physical cores supporting 12 threads, with 48 GB of ECC RAM and 16MB cache. The cluster is managed by the Torque Resource Manager 4.2.7 supporting the OpenMPI 1.4.5 programming interface ( Debian GNU/Linux 7 (wheezy) 64bit operating system. The cluster uses a shared storage area accessible via the Network Filesystem (NFS). Also, 5 Xilinx Virtex Boards and 20 Altera DE2-115, 20 Beagleboard and 20 Raspberry Pi ARM boards were acquired. Finally, we have 2 cards GTX-760 and 2 cards GTX-770 for the parallelization using CUDA API.</p>
